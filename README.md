# Multiplayer navigation

> [!WARNING]
> **Deprecated:** The pathnode navigation system was replaced by the Recast and Detour navigation system in OpenMoHAA v0.82.0.

This repository contains path files for Allied Assault, Spearhead and Breakthrough MP maps so bots can navigate.

## Installation

Download the pk3 from the `Releases` section. Choose one of the install location for the pk3:
- `~/.openmohaa/main` on Linux
- `%APPDATA%\openmohaa\main` on Windows
- if the location above is not possible, put it in the `main` folder that is inside the game directory
